### Briefly About Myself:  
    Having started my career in my first casino due to interest in the festive mood of these establishments. After the first year, I changed my mind and began to get interested in security systems and tools for them in the casino. After working for a decent amount of time, I got acquainted with the basic concepts of protecting the internal network, databases and securing remote connections. When I reached the required minimum level of competence, in my free time I began to study the front-end in order to find myself in the field of full stack developers.
